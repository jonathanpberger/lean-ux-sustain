# What it says on the tin
> How much design should a project start with? Why is Agile so tough for designers? How can designers achieve sustainable pace? There are a handful of perennial agile-and-design questions that keep coming up. Part of solving them involves acknowledging that the pace of design changes over the course of a project. Acknowledging the different rhythms—and identifying the beats that are in sync—can help teams work together in harmony.

The order of the title is scrambled. We're gonna tackle

- Agile
- The Big Design Refactor
- Sustainable Pace

<!-- ## Learning Outcomes

- How sustainable pace can contribute to better design (and happier designers)
- How the natural rhythms of design can drive expectations and deliverables in an agile environment
- How designers can work more comfortable in agile environments
- How agile techniques can benefit design

This session is the result of a lot of thinking and blogging over the past few years. The rhythms of design and development (and how they intersect) has been under-explored, and there's a lot of light to be shed on common points of friction between designers and developers on agile teams.

# Problems

- Why is Agile so tough for designers?
- How much design should a project start with?
- How can designers achieve sustainable pace?

---

# Why is Agile so tough for designers?

---

## Because we don't know when we're done
- "done" is objective in TDD development (a passing build)
- "done" is subjective in design (client sign-off? implemented & accepted designs?)

---

## Because we're in the deliverables business
- the deliverable for development is working, user-facing code
- the deliverable for design ought to be Design Solutions
- we're set up as a business to bill for mockups instead
