# Todo
- X search twitter for design complaints
- √ review my blog posts that may be germane
- ~ get talk from Sha
- X interview byron: what are his pain points?
- ? send out some public surveys
- ? get all these ideas out on index cards or post its and move them around
- What pain points led to agile dev? can I use the manifesto or the ToC for Extreme Programming Explained?

## The Plan
- get "3 challenges" in
- get "big design refactor" in
- get agile history in
- put sust'l pace in

### Sus'l Pace
- add the "empathy" story
- add the "where are all the screamers?" story
- where can I put "I got tired of nothing I designed ever being built"? Maybe tie that into the problems that led to agile dev't

- cut to 20m(!)

# What it says on the tin
> How much design should a project start with? Why is Agile so tough for designers? How can designers achieve sustainable pace? There are a handful of perennial agile-and-design questions that keep coming up. Part of solving them involves acknowledging that the pace of design changes over the course of a project. Acknowledging the different rhythms—and identifying the beats that are in sync—can help teams work together in harmony.

---

# The order
of the title is scrambled. We're gonna tackle

- Agile
- The Big Design Refactor
- Sustainable Pace

---

<!-- ## Learning Outcomes

- How sustainable pace can contribute to better design (and happier designers)
- How the natural rhythms of design can drive expectations and deliverables in an agile environment
- How designers can work more comfortable in agile environments
- How agile techniques can benefit design

---
 -->

This session is the result of a lot of thinking and blogging over the past few years. The rhythms of design and development (and how they intersect) has been under-explored, and there's a lot of light to be shed on common points of friction between designers and developers on agile teams.

---
# Empathy
- There's a homunculus inside of us, and we're treating him like shit.
- Why do we practice empathy professionally for everyone but ourselves?

---
# Problems

- Why is Agile so tough for designers?
- How much design should a project start with?
- How can designers achieve sustainable pace?

---

# Why is Agile so tough for designers?

---

## Because we don't know when we're done
- "done" is objective in TDD development (a passing build)
- "done" is subjective in design (client sign-off? implemented & accepted designs?)

---

## Because we're in the deliverables business
- the deliverable for development is working, user-facing code
- the deliverable for design ought to be Design Solutions
- we're set up as a business to bill for mockups instead

# 3 challenges
Software development has been revolutionized by Agile development practices, but designers struggle to adapt to the very same techniques—despite suffering many of the same challenges that led to Agile. What exactly are these problems? And how can Agilists and designers address them?

---
= id=done
Challenge #1
# WHEN IS DESIGN DONE?

---

Agile development preaches

## “Done means Done”.

<!-- - When a story is accepted by the Product Owner, it’s ready to be deployed out into the world.  -->

What does “done” mean for design?

---

## Automated testing

guarantees that on every story, developers will enjoy Acceptance Criteria: a concrete measure of what counts as “done”.

---

Designers, on the other hand, rely on
## subjective criteria
to determine when they’re done.

---

### In the best case,
this means the product team—or often, the designer working alone—if only they had a partner to pair with!

### In the worst case
this is purely subjective sign-off from the client.

---

Agile developers have access to tools like
## velocity
 to plan their work,

---

designers have structural difficulties in
## estimation,
and are consequently less able to plan.

---

questions like
## “when will that feature be done?”
are more easily answered by a developer than a designer.

---

That’s not because designers are less responsible than developers.
It’s because
## it’s harder to know when you’re done
with design

---

## that’s of little comfort
to anyone who needs to budget time and resources to manage the project.

---

an answer to the question “what does ‘done’ mean?”, aka
## Acceptance Criteria for design
is in different units of work than “done” for development

---

Consequently, there’s
## an impedance mismatch
in coordinating between the two.

---

## SOLUTION:
Breaking design into units of work with more discrete Acceptance Criteria helps coordinate design work with development work.

---

Challenge #2
# WHAT’S WRONG WITH THE DELIVERABLES BUSINESS?

---

Agile Developers ultimately deliver user-facing code,
## designers output design thinking:
solutions to design problems, traditionally expressed via mock-ups or assets.

---

## How should the two interact?
Should design stay an iteration ahead of development?
What does it mean when a developer discovers an interaction problem in a design they’re implementing?
Should they stop work?

---

Developers are the tip of the spear when it comes to experience design:
in the process of building software, they’re often the first people ever to use it.
Sometimes this means they uncover interactions on UX problems that the designers didn’t anticipate.
If the necessary design changes cascade into other work, what should the designer do: stop work and refactor (and fall behind), or come back to it later?

---

It can be difficult to determine how much design is required for developers to complete their work.
The best design deliverable is the Simplest Thing That Can Possibly Communicate the Design Solution,
this can vary from team to team and design problem to design problem.

---

Under ideal circumstances, an experienced designer may be able to reasonably estimate how long it will take to
1) solve the design problem,
2) communicate the solution, and
3) iterate on the problem / solution once it’s usable and testable as working software.

---

That’s asking a lot.

---

And it absolutely shreds the question
“how far ahead should design stay of development?”.

---

Challenge #3
# WHY DO DESIGNERS FEEL UNWELCOME IN AGILE?

---


Let’s take stock: we’ve got gallant developers, accurately estimating stories and delivering working software, and the
goofus designers, unable to tell you what they’re doing or when they’ll be done.

---

Knowing “how much design is enough?” is hard. Knowing how much design to start with is hard.

---

Reared in a culture that prizes individuality, that venerates Rock Star Designers, that applauds Working On It Til Its Done, that publicly shreds less-than-perfect work in Crit as a rite of passage, that (with the occasional exception) is alien to the notion of sustainable development—it shouldn’t be surprising that designers are uncomfortable.

---

> Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate.. to suffering

- Yoda

---

> rushed design leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate.. to suffering

- Not Yoda

---
That starts to lead to discord on the team: designers hating agile; feeling rushed, feeling like they don’t get the benefit of iterative design; feeling that once they touch something, they don’t get to go back and refactor it. Let’s throw in a bit of rah-rah agile ideology, a few jargon-y IPMs and retros, promises that “we’ll come back and refactor that later”, and the creeping suspicion that this whole Agile thing is nothing but smoke, mirrors, and Kool-Ade. Is it any wonder that designers can be hostile to agile?

---

What can we do? Looking to the example that Agile Development sets, we can see several concepts that may help:

- Acceptance Criteria-delimited design stories.
- Meaningful estimation of work for design.
- A culture that values Sustainable Pace.

---

Translating these ideas from development to design may do more than just help designers work more comfortably in Agile environments—it may help us practice better design.

# Big Design Refactor

## WHAT IS THE BIG DESIGN REFACTOR?
Design starts with systematic thinking and then shifts to incremental changes.
No matter where a project starts, at some point the design systems’ integrity will degrade to the point that you need to look at the whole thing fresh.
Welcome to the Big Design Refactor.
In the beginning, you had a beautiful, functional design system.
And then you had to watch, helplessly, as it degraded under the weight of a thousand tiny changes.
It’s maddening, and a big reason many designers are allergic to Agile methodologies.

---

What can you do?
Understanding and accepting that this design-system degradation is an affordance of differently-sized design and development cycles is the first step towards making peace.
Once you realize and accept this change, it’s much easier to deal with.
Plan on it.
Talk about it with your team.
Designers need not work at developers tempo.
Rather, they should strive to stay in-rhythm with development, working at their own pace, and making sure their beats and decision-points intersect with development at regular intervals.

---

As the designer, it’s your job to keep an eye on the health of the graphic system.
Just as the developers incur and pay down their technical debt, you’ll manage your design debt. How?
Mention that the graphic system is starting to break down.
All the while, you’re still doing your work.
Keep solving the tactical problems, keep delivering value.
At some point, the balance shifts: you’re no longer plugging little leaks or engaging in preventative maintenance.
The system is undermined; the cracks are starting to show.
Now’s the time to have a talk with your team.
You’re going to need a few weeks to work on this.
You’re going to need the development team to find something design-light and backend-heavy to focus on for a week or two. Hold a design retro. Get their feedback, and their buy-in, and their good ideas. And now you’ll have a break from the tactical work of patching up design as features iterate. You’re a Pure Designer again, working in your idiom, experimenting and sketching and building a new design system.

---

## HOW DOES THE BIG DESIGN REFACTOR WORK?
When I’m in the midst of a Big Design Refactor, I’m spending most of my day in Adobe Creative Suite. I’m pulling the product team over ~4-7 times a week to bounce ideas off of them. I’m pinging the development team ~1-2 times a week to consult on the technical implications of where I’m going. By the end of the week or two, I’m usually delivering a set of user stories accompanied by mockups. It’ll often take an IPM or two to get through all of them, and it’s important that they get implemented soon. Nothing feels more like waste than a heavy investment in design, followed by unacted-upon stories that go stale. This will kill trust between the design and product teams (in both directions); it’s downright poisonous.

---

Now, while the new design is being built by developers, I’ll occasionally hop back into Adobe Creative Suite for assets or newly-discovered UX tweaks, but most of my time is spent pairing with developers. I’ll also keep a close eye on acceptance. Pixel-perfection is rarely necessary, but miss an important UX point now and the error will become enshrined as part of the system.

---

Once the Design Refactor has been assimilated into the app—and it’s rare that 100% goes in, but 80-90% is the norm—it’s Tactical Incremental Fun Time! I’ll spend most of this time pairing on stories, picking of styling stories to solo on, and working on design problems revealed by user testing. At this point it’s probably 66% development and 33% Adobe apps. The debt clock is starting to tick again, and once the pain is noticeable, I’ll start making noises: “we’re ok for right this second, but we’re going to need a design refactor in the next 3-5 weeks”.

---

## WHY ARE THE RHYTHMS DIFFERENT?
Design and development are activities that move at different speeds. Test-driven development and Agile project management allow developers to break work down into small stories and iterate on them. The unit of work for the “what” of the story is “what’s the smallest possible thing that delivers value to the user?” and the “how” of the story is “what’s the simplest possible thing that can work?”. These units of work tend to translate poorly to design, because effective graphic design is almost always a system. Changing arbitrary pieces tends to degrade the whole. Design adjustments that are close in size to development units-of-work can be made, but they inevitably undermine the graphic system, creating Design Debt. Debt is fine, if used responsibly, but it needs to be paid down at some point. (More on that another time.)

---

Developers work at a quick tempo. They use Agile’s small units of work to facilitate a supple workflow that responds gracefully to changing client needs.

---

The customer wants to re-prioritize a feature? No problem! Move it to the top of the backlog and we’ll get to it next.
Because they’re backed by tests, devs are free to move around the codebase and project, making changes where the customer likes, with the confidence that their test suite will protect them from breaking the app. Designers have no such safety net—which is one reason that developing meaningful automated testing for design is crucial to a mature Agile design practice.

---

The rhythm of design is slower. Design pulls together an information architecture, UX metaphors, visual styles, a typographic system, a color system. Visual rhythm, hierarchies, and scale combine into a whole graphic system—more than the sum of its parts. All these pieces interrelate, and changes cascade into other. While adjustments to individual design elements can happen quickly, feature-scale iteration doesn’t allow for changes to the system; those take more time.

---

## TL;DR
- Ideally, bring a cohesive graphic system to Inception. 
- Accept that it will degrade over time. 
Make tactical adjustments to keep pace with agile development, and plan on overhauling the design system every quarter or so.
