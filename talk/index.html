<h1>What it says on the tin</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>How much design should a project start with? Why is Agile so tough for designers? How can designers achieve sustainable pace? There are a handful of perennial agile-and-design questions that keep coming up. Part of solving them involves acknowledging that the pace of design changes over the course of a project. Acknowledging the different rhythms—and identifying the beats that are in sync—can help teams work together in harmony.</p>

<!-- ## Learning Outcomes

- How sustainable pace can contribute to better design (and happier designers)
- How the natural rhythms of design can drive expectations and deliverables in an agile environment
- How designers can work more comfortable in agile environments
- How agile techniques can benefit design

<p>This session is the result of a lot of thinking and blogging over the past few years. The rhythms of design and development (and how they intersect) has been under-explored, and there&#39;s a lot of light to be shed on common points of friction between designers and developers on agile teams.</p>

<h2>Because we don&#39;t know when we&#39;re done</h2>

<ul>
<li>&quot;done&quot; is objective in TDD development (a passing build)</li>
<li>&quot;done&quot; is subjective in design (client sign-off? implemented &amp; accepted designs?)</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Because we&#39;re in the deliverables business</h2>

<ul>
<li>the deliverable for development is working, user-facing code</li>
<li>the deliverable for design ought to be Design Solutions</li>
<li>we&#39;re set up as a business to bill for mockups instead</li>
