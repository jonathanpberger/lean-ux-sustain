<!-- There are a handful of perennial agile-and-design questions that keep coming up. Part of solving them involves acknowledging that the pace of design changes over the course of a project. Acknowledging the different rhythms—and identifying the beats that are in sync—can help teams work together in harmony. -->

<!-- ## Learning Outcomes

- How sustainable pace can contribute to better design (and happier designers)
- How the natural rhythms of design can drive expectations and deliverables in an agile environment
- How designers can work more comfortable in agile environments
- How agile techniques can benefit design

<!-- This session is the result of a lot of thinking and blogging over the past few years. The rhythms of design and development (and how they intersect) has been under-explored, and there's a lot of light to be shed on common points of friction between designers and developers on agile teams.

<p>I first realized something was amiss when I started going to meetups</p>

<h2>Developers were confidant</h2>

<h2>Designers were timid</h2>

<h1>Why is Agile so tough for designers?</h1>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Because we don&#39;t know <br /> when we&#39;re done</h2>

<ul>
<li>&quot;done&quot; is objective in TDD development (a passing build)</li>
<li>&quot;done&quot; is subjective in design (client sign-off? implemented &amp; accepted designs?)</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Because we&#39;re in <br /> the deliverables business</h2>

<ul>
<li>the deliverable for development is working, user-facing code</li>
<li>the deliverable for design ought to be Design Solutions</li>
<li>we&#39;re set up as a business to bill for mockups instead</li>

<h1>3 challenges</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Software development has been revolutionized by Agile development practices, but
designers struggle to adapt to the very same techniques—
despite suffering many of the same challenges that led to Agile.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What exactly are these problems? And how can Agilists and designers address them?</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Challenge #1</p>

<h1>WHEN IS DESIGN DONE?</h1>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Agile development preaches</p>

<h2>“Done means Done”.</h2>

<!-- - When a story is accepted by the Product Owner, it’s ready to be deployed out into the world.  -->

<p>What does “done” mean for design?</p>
</div>
      <div class='step'  id=done>
    
<h2>Automated testing</h2>

<p>guarantees that on every story, developers will enjoy <strong>Acceptance Criteria</strong>:</p>

<h3>a concrete measure of what counts as “done”.</h3>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Designers, on the other hand, rely on</p>

<h2>subjective criteria</h2>

<p>to determine when they’re done.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h3>In the best case,</h3>

<p>this means the product team—or often, the designer working alone—if only they had a partner to pair with!</p>

<h3>In the worst case</h3>

<p>this is purely subjective sign-off from the client.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Agile developers have access to tools like</p>

<h2>velocity</h2>

<p>to plan their work,</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>designers have structural difficulties in</p>

<h2>estimation,</h2>

<p>and are consequently less able to plan.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>questions like</p>

<h2>“when will that feature be done?”</h2>

<p>are more easily answered by a developer than a designer.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>That’s not because designers are less responsible than developers.
It’s because</p>

<h2>it’s harder to know when you’re done</h2>

<p>with design</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>that’s of little comfort</h2>

<p>to anyone who needs to budget time and resources to manage the project.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>an answer to the question “what does ‘done’ mean?”, aka</p>

<h2>Acceptance Criteria for design</h2>

<p>is in different units of work than “done” for development</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Consequently, there’s</p>

<h2>an impedance mismatch</h2>

<p>in coordinating between the two.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>SOLUTION:</h2>

<h3>Breaking design into units of work with <br /><strong>more discrete Acceptance Criteria</strong><br />helps coordinate design and development work.</h3>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Challenge #2</p>

<h1>WHAT’S WRONG WITH THE DELIVERABLES BUSINESS?</h1>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Agile Developers ultimately deliver user-facing code,</p>

<h2>designers output design thinking:</h2>

<p>solutions to design problems, traditionally expressed via mock-ups or assets.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>How should the two interact?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Should design stay an iteration ahead of development?</li>
<li>What happens when developers discover interaction problems during implementation?</li>
<li>Should they stop work?</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<!-- Developers are the tip of the spear when it comes to experience design:
in the process of building software, they’re often the first people ever to use it.
Sometimes this means they uncover interactions on UX problems that the designers didn’t anticipate.
If the necessary design changes cascade into other work, what should the designer do: stop work and refactor (and fall behind), or come back to it later?

<p>It can be <strong>difficult to determine</strong></p>

<p>for developers to complete their work</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>The best design deliverable is</p>

<h2>Under ideal circumstances,</h2>

<p>an experienced designer <em>may</em> be able to reasonably estimate how long it will take to:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>solve</strong> the design problem,</li>
<li><strong>communicate</strong> the solution, and</li>
<li><strong>iterate</strong> on the problem / solution once it’s usable and testable as working software.</li>
</ol>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>(That’s asking a lot.)</p>

<!-- ## HOW DOES THE BIG DESIGN REFACTOR WORK?
When I’m in the midst of a Big Design Refactor, I’m spending most of my day in Adobe Creative Suite. I’m pulling the product team over ~4-7 times a week to bounce ideas off of them. I’m pinging the development team ~1-2 times a week to consult on the technical implications of where I’m going. By the end of the week or two, I’m usually delivering a set of user stories accompanied by mockups. It’ll often take an IPM or two to get through all of them, and it’s important that they get implemented soon. Nothing feels more like waste than a heavy investment in design, followed by unacted-upon stories that go stale. This will kill trust between the design and product teams (in both directions); it’s downright poisonous.

---

Now, while the new design is being built by developers, I’ll occasionally hop back into Adobe Creative Suite for assets or newly-discovered UX tweaks, but most of my time is spent pairing with developers. I’ll also keep a close eye on acceptance. Pixel-perfection is rarely necessary, but miss an important UX point now and the error will become enshrined as part of the system.

---

Once the Design Refactor has been assimilated into the app—and it’s rare that 100% goes in, but 80-90% is the norm—it’s Tactical Incremental Fun Time! I’ll spend most of this time pairing on stories, picking of styling stories to solo on, and working on design problems revealed by user testing. At this point it’s probably 66% development and 33% Adobe apps. The debt clock is starting to tick again, and once the pain is noticeable, I’ll start making noises: “we’re ok for right this second, but we’re going to need a design refactor in the next 3-5 weeks”.

--- -->

<h2>WHY ARE THE RHYTHMS DIFFERENT?</h2>

<p>Design and development are activities that move at different speeds. Test-driven development and Agile project management allow developers to break work down into small stories and iterate on them. The unit of work for the “what” of the story is “what’s the smallest possible thing that delivers value to the user?” and the “how” of the story is “what’s the simplest possible thing that can work?”. These units of work tend to translate poorly to design, because effective graphic design is almost always a system. Changing arbitrary pieces tends to degrade the whole. Design adjustments that are close in size to development units-of-work can be made, but they inevitably undermine the graphic system, creating Design Debt. Debt is fine, if used responsibly, but it needs to be paid down at some point. (More on that another time.)</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Developers work at a quick tempo. They use Agile’s small units of work to facilitate a supple workflow that responds gracefully to changing client needs.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>The customer wants to re-prioritize a feature? No problem! Move it to the top of the backlog and we’ll get to it next.
Because they’re backed by tests, devs are free to move around the codebase and project, making changes where the customer likes, with the confidence that their test suite will protect them from breaking the app. Designers have no such safety net—which is one reason that developing meaningful automated testing for design is crucial to a mature Agile design practice.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>The rhythm of design is slower. Design pulls together an information architecture, UX metaphors, visual styles, a typographic system, a color system. Visual rhythm, hierarchies, and scale combine into a whole graphic system—more than the sum of its parts. All these pieces interrelate, and changes cascade into other. While adjustments to individual design elements can happen quickly, feature-scale iteration doesn’t allow for changes to the system; those take more time.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<ul>
<li>Ideally, bring a cohesive graphic system to Inception.</li>
<li>Accept that it will degrade over time.
Make tactical adjustments to keep pace with agile development, and plan on overhauling the design system every quarter or so.</li>
</ul>

<p>When we talk about Agile nad Design, it&#39;s often a story about &quot;how can designers cope w/ Agile practices&quot;</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>this is a disservice.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Developers created agile to deal w/ problems they were having in their practice</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Design has similar problems</p>

<p>how can we leverage and apply their solutions?</p>

<li>Designers aren&#39;t listened to.</li>
<li>Designers work crazy hours.</li>
<li>Designers spend time designing things that are never built</li>
<li>We don&#39;t get in front of users early enough</li>

<p>Software development has been revolutionized by Agile practices</p>

<h1>BUT</h1>

<p>designers struggle to adapt the same techniques</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<ul>
<li>Designers will benefit from adopting Agile techniques,</li>
<li>We should start with Sustainable Pace,</li>
<li>This is a cultural shift we&#39;ll need to advocate for.</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h1>Why Now?</h1>

<ul>
<li>The Lean UX book is out!</li>
<li>We&#39;re starting to codify some of these techniques!</li>
<li>Now is an opportune time to review the intersection of Agile and Design</li>

<!-- # Origin Story

---

I started as
# a self-taught designer

---

I worked on [Spot.Us](http://spot.us) and
# found Agile and fell in love.

---

# I wanted to bring Agile to design.

---

I found Pivotal, and
# they needed an Agile designer

---

#Sweet!

---

Now Pivotal is building
# a Product and Design practice

<h2>Top 3 areas for improvement:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Acceptance Criteria-delimited design stories

<ul>
<li><em>(What counts as &#39;done&#39;?)</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Meaningful estimation of work for design

<ul>
<li><em>(When will it be done?)</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>A culture that values Sustainable Pace

<ul>
<li><em>(How can we keep doing it?)</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h1>Sustainable pace</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>What does it mean to maintain a constant pace indefinitely in design?</h2>

<ul>
<li>A healthy, human practice (TimeOut, ping pong, 40-hour weeks)</li>
<li><s>rock stars</s> collaborative practices</li>
<li>Build and share a better toolkit (a lot of this work is already being done by the Lean UX movement)</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h1>Why Sustainable Pace First?</h1>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h1>Area of greatest risk</h1>

<ul>
<li>It requires a shift in the traditional design fixed-bid billing model</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Why Sustainable Pace First?</h2>

<ul>
<li>It&#39;s the most in our control,</li>
<li>It&#39;s the foundation upon which we can build these other things,</li>
<li>Designers deserve to be happy!</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h1>It&#39;ll be an uphill battle</h1>

<ul>
<li>But it&#39;s only a messaging problem (not a product problem).</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>What next?</h2>

<ul>
<li>We have to spread the word,</li>
<li>argue about it,</li>
<li>argue for it.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Notes</h1>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h1>What problems does the Agile Manifesto solve?</h1>

<ul>
<li>The first problem is killing developer productivity by constantly shifting priorities and directions.</li>
<li>The second problem is an inability for product owners to make well-informed tradeoffs around priorities.</li>
<li>The third problem is having too many unnecessary meetings and status checks.</li>
<li>The fourth problem is an inability to accurately predict when a project will be done, primarily with the aim of either cutting scope or moving the deadline (or adding developers, which is always dicey), and knowing that one of those will need to be done as much ahead of time as possible.</li>
<li>The fifth problem is frustrated developers due to poorly-defined features.</li>
<li>The sixth problem is the temptation to adjust the quality knob in order to meet a date target.</li>
<li>Lastly, this isn’t so much a problem per se, but agile builds in time for reflection on the product and the process.</li>
</ul>

<h1>History of the Agile Manifesto</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>At the core, I believe Agile Methodologists are really about &quot;mushy&quot; stuff�about delivering good products to customers by operating in an environment that does more than talk about &quot;people as our most important asset&quot; but actually &quot;acts&quot; as if people were the most important, and lose the word &quot;asset&quot;. So in the final analysis, the meteoric rise of interest in�and sometimes tremendous criticism of�Agile Methodologies is about the mushy stuff of values and culture.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<blockquote>
<p>This type of situation goes on every day�marketing, or management, or external customers, internal customers, and, yes, even developers�don�t want to make hard trade-off decisions, so they impose irrational demands through the imposition of corporate power structures. This isn�t merely a software development problem, it runs throughout Dilbertesque organizations.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<blockquote>
<p>We plan, but recognize the limits of planning in a turbulent environment.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<ul>
<li>Constantly shifting priorities,</li>
<li>An unwillingness to make hard decisions,</li>
<li>Unnecessary meetings and busywork,</li>
<li>An inability to accurately predict when a project will be done,</li>
<li>Poorly-defined features,</li>
<li>The temptation to adjust the quality knob in order to meet a date target,</li>
<li>No time for reflection on the product and the process.</li>
