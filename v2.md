# What it says on the tin
> Why is Agile so tough for designers?

> How much design should a project start with?

> How can designers achieve sustainable pace?
-->

<!-- There are a handful of perennial agile-and-design questions that keep coming up. Part of solving them involves acknowledging that the pace of design changes over the course of a project. Acknowledging the different rhythms—and identifying the beats that are in sync—can help teams work together in harmony.

*not* Product companies.

---

This funny thing happens. Whenever we talk about Agile and Design,
# we talk about ways for designers deal with Agile

---

Why aren't we talking about
# What Agile can do for Design?

<!-- ---

Software development has been revolutionized by Agile practices, but
## designers struggle to adapt the same techniques -->

---

## TL;DR
- Designers will benefit from adopting Agile techniques,
- We should start with Sustainable Pace,
- This is a cultural shift we'll need to advocate for.

---

# Once upon a time
<!-- waynes world gif -->

---

## Developers had problems

- Sclerosis around processes and tools,
- Compulsive (CYA) documentation,
- Endless negotiation about targets and deliverables,
- A fixation on following an old plan in a new situation.

---

What happened?

## Then Agile happened.

---

- *Individuals & interactions* over processes & tools
- *Working software* over comprehensive documentation
- *Customer collaboration* over contract negotiation
- *Responding to change* over following a plan

---

### (Let's see that again)
- Sclerosis around processes and tools,
- Compulsive (CYA) documentation,
- Endless negotiation about targets and deliverables,
- A fixation on following an old plan in a new situation.

---

## Designers have analogous problems

#### Sclerosis around processes and tools,
### Designers use PSDs to represent interaction

#### Compulsive (CYA) documentation,
### Designers are paid by the deliverable!

#### Endless negotiation about targets and deliverables,
### Designers are terrible at estimating when we're done

#### A fixation on following an old plan in a new situation.
### Designers are terrible at defining what 'done' means


---

<!-- ## Agile can haz Solutions for Design

- Sclerosis around processes and tools,

### 1. Communicate design solutions at the correct level of resolution

- Compulsive (CYA) documentation,

### 2. Get out of the deliverables business

- Endless negotiation about targets and deliverables,

### 3. Shared ownership -> Product watching designers back and giving them room

- A fixation on following an old plan in a new situation.

### 4. Define Acceptance Criteria -->


---

And yet...
## Designers still struggle w/ Agile

---

<!-- # What can Agile bring to Design?
- Sustainable pace.
- Shared ownership of product.
- More predictable acceptance criteria.
- All the benefits of pairing.
- All the benefits of testing. -->


<!-- ---

There is a
# Sickness in Design Culture

---

# Symptoms of this sickness
- Designers aren't listened to.
- Designers work crazy hours.
- Designers spend time designing things that are never built
- We don't get in front of users early enough
- imbalance between Design's effect and it's voice on the team

---

I first realized something was amiss when I started going to meetups

## Developers were confidant

## Designers were timid


---

## In meetings,
- devs talk, client say "ok".
- designers talk, client say "I have an opinion too"

---

## How to reconcile
- "devs are golden" and "design is a high-leverage activity" reconcile?
- **CURIOUS!**

---

- I believe designers are in pain
- show them how to cope

---

# The Oppressed Designer

- Long nights
- "I got tired of nothing I designed ever being built"
- "Where are you hiding the people who yell at you" -> Insecure Design
- UX Designers are more scared of Developers than of Business People" —@thinknow

--- -->

# Why is Agile so tough for designers?


---

## 1 we don't communicate at the proper level of resolution

<!-- - Sclerosis around processes and tools,

### Communicate design solutions at the correct level of resolution -->

---

## 2 Because we're in <br /> the deliverables business
- the deliverable for development is working, user-facing code
- the deliverable for design ought to be Design Solutions
- we're set up as a business to bill for mockups instead

<!-- - Compulsive (CYA) documentation,

### Get out of the deliverables business -->

---

## 3 We don't estimate well

<!-- - Endless negotiation about targets and deliverables,

### Shared ownership -> Product watching designers back and giving them room -->

---

## 4 Because we don't know <br /> when we're done
- "done" is objective in TDD development (a passing build)
- "done" is subjective in design (client sign-off? implemented & accepted designs?)

<!-- - A fixation on following an old plan in a new situation.

### Define Acceptance Criteria -->


---

What compounds the estimation problem? The fact that we do
## Fixed-bid *vs.* <br /> Time-and-Materials billing
(more about that later)

---

I've only got 20m, so we're only going to talk about the first one here:
## Individuals & Interactions over processes & tools.
<!-- ## Solution: the big design refactor -->

---
= id=bigdesignrefactor

The
# Big Design Refactor

---

<!-- ## BDR helps make sense of Agile Rhythm
- Dev: INVEST, small pieces
- Design: Malleable, never done, wholistic

---

## BDR Solution: Acceptance is important
- let go for _____ parts
- seize the momentum for ______ parts -->

---

<!-- ## WHAT IS THE BIG DESIGN REFACTOR?

--- -->

<!-- ## (Visual) Design starts with <br /> *systematic thinking*

--- -->

<!-- ## and (product design) then shifts to <br /> *incremental changes*.

---
 -->
<!-- No matter where a project starts, -->
<!-- ## at some point the design systems’ integrity will degrade -->
<!-- to the point that you need to look at the whole thing fresh. -->

<!-- ---

# Welcome to the Big Design Refactor. -->

---

<!-- In the beginning, you had a -->
## Beautiful, well-considered visual design system
<!-- Type, whitespace, etc. -->

---

Then
## the project got Agile

---
<!-- And then you had to watch, helplessly, as your design system -->
## degraded under the weight of a thousand tiny changes.

---

<!-- nobody's being an asshole; it's just that
## Domain discovery => changes in semantics => changes in design -->

## designers have to play catch-up in a race they can't win

---

<!-- It’s maddening, and a big reason -->
<!-- ## many designers are allergic to Agile methodologies.

--- -->

## What can you do?

---

## Understand and accept

---

## this design-system degradation is an affordance of differently-sized design and development cycles

---

## Development solutions: I.N.V.E.S.T., small pieces
## Design solutions: Malleable, never done, holistic

---

<!-- ## No one's at fault -->

<!-- is the first step towards making peace. -->

<!-- ![cycles](cycles.png) -->

<!-- --- -->

<!-- Once you realize and -->
<!-- ## accept this change, -->
<!-- it’s much easier to deal with. -->

---
= id=prayer

## Agile Designers Prayer

> Grant me the serenity

> To accept the things I cannot change;

> The courage to change the things I can;

> And the wisdom to know the difference.

---

## Designers need not work at developers tempo.

---

<!-- Rather, they should strive to -->
## stay in-rhythm with development,
<!-- working at their own pace, and making sure their beats and decision-points intersect with development at regular intervals. -->

---
## Communicate
<!-- ## Plan on it.
Talk about it with your team. -->

---

<!-- As the designer, it’s your job to -->
## keep an eye on the health of the graphic system.

---

<!-- Just as the developers incur and pay down their technical debt, you’ll -->
## manage your design debt.

---

## How?
- Mention that the graphic system is starting to break down.
- All the while, you’re still doing your work.
- Keep solving the tactical problems, keep delivering value.

---

<!-- At some point, -->
## the balance shifts

<!-- ---

you’re no longer
## plugging little leaks or engaging in preventative maintenance.

---
## The system is undermined;
the cracks are starting to show.
 -->

---

Now’s the time to
## talk with your team.

---

## You need time
<!-- You’re going to need the development team to find something design-light and backend-heavy to focus on for a week or two. -->

---

<!-- Hold a design retro. -->
## Get their feedback,
<!-- and their buy-in, and their good ideas. -->

---

<!-- And now you’ll have a break from the tactical work of patching up design as features iterate. -->
## You’re a Pure Designer again,
<!-- working in your idiom, experimenting and sketching and building a new design system. -->


---

<!-- # BTW
- "I do" language is better than "you should" language
- I sound like a Hero Designer here. Where's the team? Where's the collaboration?
- Can this be more less "I" language and more "facilitator" language?

---- -->

<!--
## Top 3 areas for improvement:

- Acceptance Criteria-delimited design stories
	- *(What counts as 'done'?)*
- Meaningful estimation of work for design
	- *(When will it be done?)*
- A culture that values Sustainable Pace
	- *(How can we keep doing it?)* -->

## BDR recap
1. accept
2. plan
3. communicate
4. refactor

---

# INTERLUDE: NONE OF THIS IS POSSIBLE IN A FIXED-BID WORLD

---

## Fixed-bid *vs.* <br /> Time-and-Materials billing

---

# Why Sustainable Pace First?

---

# Area of greatest risk

- It requires a shift in the traditional design fixed-bid billing model

---

## Why Sustainable Pace First?

- It's the most in our control,
- It's the foundation upon which we can build these other things,
- Designers deserve to be happy!

---

# Sustainable pace

> Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

---

## What does it mean to maintain a constant pace indefinitely in design?

- Empathy for self
- A healthy, human practice (TimeOut, ping pong, 40-hour weeks)
- <s>rock stars</s> collaborative practices
- Build and share a better toolkit (a lot of this work is already being done by the Lean UX movement)


---

# It'll be an uphill battle
- But it's only a messaging problem (not a product problem).

---

## What next?

- We have to spread the word,
- argue about it,
- argue for it.
