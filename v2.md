# Sustainable Pace, Agile, and The Big Design Refactor

# Hi!

= id=jonathanpberger

# I'm @jonathanpberger

---

I read and write code every day to build **products** and **practice** at

## @pivotallabs

---

## WARNINGS:
- we're mostly talking about Apps, (*not* content sites.)
- we're mostly talking about Consultancies, (*not* Product companies.)

---

This funny thing happens. Whenever we talk about Agile and Design,
# we talk about ways for designers deal with Agile

---

Why aren't we talking about
# What Agile can do for Design?

---

## TL;DR
- Designers will benefit from adopting Agile techniques,
- We should start with Sustainable Pace,
- This is a cultural shift we'll need to advocate for.

---

# Once upon a time...

---

## Developers had problems

- Sclerosis around processes and tools,
- Compulsive (CYA) documentation,
- Endless negotiation about targets and deliverables,
- A fixation on following an old plan in a new situation.

---

What happened?

## Then Agile happened.

---

- *Individuals & interactions* over processes & tools
- *Working software* over comprehensive documentation
- *Customer collaboration* over contract negotiation
- *Responding to change* over following a plan

---

### (Let's see that again)
- Sclerosis around processes and tools,
- Compulsive (CYA) documentation,
- Endless negotiation about targets and deliverables,
- A fixation on following an old plan in a new situation.

---

## Designers have analogous problems

---

#### 1. Sclerosis around processes and tools,
### Designers use PSDs to represent interaction

---

#### 2. Compulsive (CYA) documentation,
### Designers are paid by the deliverable!

---

#### 3. Endless negotiation about targets and deliverables,
### Designers are terrible at estimating when we're done

---

#### 4. A fixation on following an old plan in a new situation.
### Designers are terrible at defining what 'done' means

---

And yet...
## Designers still struggle w/ Agile

---

# Why is Agile so tough for designers?

---

## 1. we don't communicate at the proper level of resolution

---

## 2. Because we're in <br /> the deliverables business
- the deliverable for development is working, user-facing code
- the deliverable for design ought to be Design Solutions
- we're set up as a business to bill for mockups instead

---

## 3. We don't estimate well

---

## 4. Because we don't know <br /> when we're done
- "done" is objective in TDD development (a passing build)
- "done" is subjective in design (client sign-off? implemented & accepted designs?)

---

What compounds the estimation problem? The fact that we do
## Fixed-bid *vs.* <br /> Time-and-Materials billing
(more about that later)

---

I've only got 20m, so we're only going to talk about the first one here:
## Individuals & Interactions over processes & tools.

The
# Big Design Refactor

---

---

## In the beginning...

---

Then
## the project got Agile

---

## degraded under the weight of a thousand tiny changes.

---

## designers have to play catch-up in a race they can't win

---

this is
## infuriating

---

## What can you do?

---

## Understand and accept

---

## this design-system degradation is an affordance of differently-sized design and development cycles

---

## Development solutions: I.N.V.E.S.T., small pieces
## Design solutions: Malleable, never done, holistic

---
= id=prayer

## Agile Designers Prayer

> Grant me the serenity

> To accept the things I cannot change;

> The courage to change the things I can;

> And the wisdom to know the difference.

---

## Designers need not work at developers tempo.

---

## stay in-rhythm with development,

---

## Communicate

---

## keep an eye on the health of the graphic system.

---

## manage your design debt.

---

## How?
- Mention that the graphic system is starting to break down.
- All the while, you’re still doing your work.
- Keep solving the tactical problems, keep delivering value.

---

## the balance shifts

---

Now’s the time to
## talk with your team.

---

## You need time

---

## Get their feedback,

---

## You’re a Pure Designer again

---

## BDR recap
1. accept
2. plan
3. communicate
4. refactor

---

# INTERLUDE: NONE OF THIS IS POSSIBLE IN A FIXED-BID WORLD

---

## Fixed-bid *vs.* <br /> Time-and-Materials billing

---

# Why Sustainable Pace First?

---

# Area of greatest risk

- It requires a shift in the traditional design fixed-bid billing model

---

- It's the most in our control,
- It's the foundation upon which we can build these other things,
- Designers deserve to be happy!

---

> Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

---

## What does it mean to maintain a constant pace indefinitely in design?

- Empathy for self
- A healthy, human practice (TimeOut, ping pong, 40-hour weeks)
- <s>rock stars</s> collaborative practices
- Build and share a better toolkit (a lot of this work is already being done by the Lean UX movement)

---

# It'll be an uphill battle
- But it's only a messaging problem (not a product problem).

---

## What next?

- We have to spread the word,
- argue about it,
- argue for it.
