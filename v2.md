# What problems does the Agile Manifesto solve?

- The first problem is killing developer productivity by constantly shifting priorities and directions.
- The second problem is an inability for product owners to make well-informed tradeoffs around priorities.
- The third problem is having too many unnecessary meetings and status checks.
- The fourth problem is an inability to accurately predict when a project will be done, primarily with the aim of either cutting scope or moving the deadline (or adding developers, which is always dicey), and knowing that one of those will need to be done as much ahead of time as possible.
- The fifth problem is frustrated developers due to poorly-defined features.
- The sixth problem is the temptation to adjust the quality knob in order to meet a date target.
- Lastly, this isn’t so much a problem per se, but agile builds in time for reflection on the product and the process.

# What can Agile bring to Design?
- Sustainable pace.
- Shared ownership of product.
- More predictable acceptance criteria.
- All the benefits of pairing.
- All the benefits of testing.

<!-- 789-828 -->

Hey designers, does this
# Sound familiar?

---

## (Let's see that again)
- Sclerosis around processes and tools,
- Compulsive (CYA) documentation,
- Endless negotiation about targets and deliverables,
- A fixation on following an old plan in a new situation.

---

# What happened?

---

# Agile happened.

---

- *Individuals & interactions* over processes & tools
- *Working software* over comprehensive documentation
- *Customer collaboration* over contract negotiation
- *Responding to change* over following a plan

---

Software development has been revolutionized by Agile practices

# BUT

designers struggle to adapt the same techniques

---

## TL;DR
- Designers will benefit from adopting Agile techniques,
- We should start with Sustainable Pace,
- This is a cultural shift we'll need to advocate for.

---

<!-- 158-162 -->
> Software development has been revolutionized by Agile development practices, but
designers struggle to adapt to the very same techniques—
despite suffering many of the same challenges that led to Agile.

What exactly are these problems? And how can Agilists and designers address them?


---

<!-- 96-100 -->
I first realized something was amiss when I started going to meetups

## Developers were confidant

## Designers were timid


---

## In meetings,
- devs talk, client say "ok".
- designers talk, client say "I have an opinion too"

---

## How to reconcile
- "devs are golden" and "design is a high-leverage activity" reconcile?
- **CURIOUS!**

There is a
# Sickness
in Design Culture

---

# Symptoms of this sickness
- Designers aren't listened to.
- Designers work crazy hours.
- Designers spend time designing things that are never built
- We don't get in front of users early enough
- imbalance between Design's effect and it's voice on the team

---

- I believe designers are in pain
- show them how to cope

---

<!-- 104-132 ? -->
# The Oppressed Designer

- Long nights
- "I got tired of nothing I designed ever being built"
- "Where are you hiding the people who yell at you" --> Insecure Design
- UX Designers are more scared of Developers than of Business People" —@thinknow


---


# Why is Agile so tough for designers?

---

## Because we don't know <br /> when we're done
- "done" is objective in TDD development (a passing build)
- "done" is subjective in design (client sign-off? implemented & accepted designs?)

---

## Because we're in <br /> the deliverables business
- the deliverable for development is working, user-facing code
- the deliverable for design ought to be Design Solutions
- we're set up as a business to bill for mockups instead

---

## Fixed-bid *vs.* <br /> Time-and-Materials billing

---

<!-- 402-457 -->

---

## Agile Rhythm
- Dev: INVEST, small pieces
- Design: Malleable, never done, wholistic

---

## Acceptance is important
- let go for _____ parts
- seize the momentum for ______ parts

---

The
# Big Design Refactor

---

## WHAT IS THE BIG DESIGN REFACTOR?

---

## Design starts with <br /> *systematic thinking*

---

## and then shifts to <br /> *incremental changes*.

---

No matter where a project starts,
## at some point the design systems’ integrity will degrade
to the point that you need to look at the whole thing fresh.

---

# Welcome to the Big Design Refactor.

---

In the beginning, you had a
## Beautiful, well-considered visual design system
Type, whitespace, etc.

---

Then
## the project got Agile

---
And then you had to watch, helplessly, as your design system
## degraded under the weight of a thousand tiny changes.

---

Domain discovery => changes in semantic

---

It’s maddening, and a big reason
## many designers are allergic to Agile methodologies.

---

## What can you do?

---

Understanding and accepting that
## this design-system degradation is an affordance of differently-sized design and development cycles
is the first step towards making peace.

---

Once you realize and
## accept this change,
it’s much easier to deal with.

---

## Agile Designers Prayer

> grant me the serenity

> to accept the things I cannot change;

> courage to change the things I can;

> and wisdom to know the difference.

---

## Communicate
Plan on it.
Talk about it with your team.

---

## Designers need not work at developers tempo.

---

Rather, they should strive to
## stay in-rhythm with development,
working at their own pace, and making sure their beats and decision-points intersect with development at regular intervals.

---

As the designer, it’s your job to
## keep an eye on the health of the graphic system.

---

Just as the developers incur and pay down their technical debt, you’ll
## manage your design debt.

---

## How?
- Mention that the graphic system is starting to break down.
- All the while, you’re still doing your work.
- Keep solving the tactical problems, keep delivering value.

---

At some point,
## the balance shifts

---

you’re no longer
## plugging little leaks or engaging in preventative maintenance.

---
## The system is undermined;
the cracks are starting to show.

---

Now’s the time to
## have a talk with your team.

---

## You’re going to need a few weeks to work on this.
You’re going to need the development team to find something design-light and backend-heavy to focus on for a week or two.

---

Hold a design retro.
## Get their feedback,
and their buy-in, and their good ideas.

---

And now you’ll have a break from the tactical work of patching up design as features iterate.
## You’re a Pure Designer again,
working in your idiom, experimenting and sketching and building a new design system.


---

# BTW
- "I do" language is better than "you should" language
- I sound like a Hero Designer here. Where's the team? Where's the collaboration?
- Can this be more less "I" language and more "facilitator" language?

----


## Top 3 areas for improvement:

- Acceptance Criteria-delimited design stories
	- *(What counts as 'done'?)*
- Meaningful estimation of work for design
	- *(When will it be done?)*
- A culture that values Sustainable Pace
	- *(How can we keep doing it?)*

---

# Sustainable pace

> Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

---

## What does it mean to maintain a constant pace indefinitely in design?

- A healthy, human practice (TimeOut, ping pong, 40-hour weeks)
- <s>rock stars</s> collaborative practices
- Build and share a better toolkit (a lot of this work is already being done by the Lean UX movement)

---

# Why Sustainable Pace First?

---

# Area of greatest risk

- It requires a shift in the traditional design fixed-bid billing model

---

## Why Sustainable Pace First?

- It's the most in our control,
- It's the foundation upon which we can build these other things,
- Designers deserve to be happy!

---

# It'll be an uphill battle
- But it's only a messaging problem (not a product problem).

---

## What next?

- We have to spread the word,
- argue about it,
- argue for it.
