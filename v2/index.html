<!-- There are a handful of perennial agile-and-design questions that keep coming up. Part of solving them involves acknowledging that the pace of design changes over the course of a project. Acknowledging the different rhythms—and identifying the beats that are in sync—can help teams work together in harmony.

<p>This funny thing happens. Whenever we talk about Agile and Design, we talk about ways for designers to weather the Agile storm</p>

<p>Why aren&#39;t we talking about</p>

<h1>What Agile can do for Design?</h1>

<p>Software development has been revolutionized by Agile practices, but</p>

<h2>designers struggle to adapt the same techniques</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<ul>
<li>Designers will benefit from adopting Agile techniques,</li>
<li>We should start with Sustainable Pace,</li>
<li>This is a cultural shift we&#39;ll need to advocate for.</li>

<h2>Developers had problems</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sclerosis around processes and tools,</li>

<h2>Designers have analogous problems</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sclerosis around processes and tools,</li>

<ul>
<li>Compulsive (CYA) documentation,</li>
</ul>

<h3>Designers are paid by the deliverable!</h3>

<ul>
<li>Endless negotiation about targets and deliverables,</li>
</ul>

<h3>Designers are terrible at estimating when we&#39;re done</h3>

<li>A fixation on following an old plan in a new situation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Designers are terrible at defining what &#39;done&#39; means</h3>

<h2>Then Agile happened.</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<ul>
<li><em>Individuals &amp; interactions</em> over processes &amp; tools</li>
<li><em>Working software</em> over comprehensive documentation</li>

<h3>2. Get out of the deliverables business</h3>

</ul>

<h3>3. Shared ownership -&gt; Product watching designers back and giving them room</h3>

<h3>4. Define Acceptance Criteria</h3>

There is a
# Sickness in Design Culture

---

# Symptoms of this sickness
- Designers aren't listened to.
- Designers work crazy hours.
- Designers spend time designing things that are never built
- We don't get in front of users early enough
- imbalance between Design's effect and it's voice on the team

---

I first realized something was amiss when I started going to meetups

## Developers were confidant

## Designers were timid


---

## In meetings,
- devs talk, client say "ok".
- designers talk, client say "I have an opinion too"

---

## How to reconcile
- "devs are golden" and "design is a high-leverage activity" reconcile?
- **CURIOUS!**

---

- I believe designers are in pain
- show them how to cope

---

# The Oppressed Designer

- Long nights
- "I got tired of nothing I designed ever being built"
- "Where are you hiding the people who yell at you" -> Insecure Design
- UX Designers are more scared of Developers than of Business People" —@thinknow

<h1>Why is Agile so tough for designers?</h1>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>1 we don&#39;t communicate at the proper level of resolution</h2>

<!-- - Sclerosis around processes and tools,

### Communicate design solutions at the correct level of resolution -->
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>2 Because we&#39;re in <br /> the deliverables business</h2>

<ul>
<li>the deliverable for development is working, user-facing code</li>
<li>the deliverable for design ought to be Design Solutions</li>
<li>we&#39;re set up as a business to bill for mockups instead</li>
</ul>

<!-- - Compulsive (CYA) documentation,

### Get out of the deliverables business -->
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>3 We don&#39;t estimate well</h2>

<!-- - Endless negotiation about targets and deliverables,

### Shared ownership -> Product watching designers back and giving them room -->
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>4 Because we don&#39;t know <br /> when we&#39;re done</h2>

<ul>
<li>&quot;done&quot; is objective in TDD development (a passing build)</li>
<li>&quot;done&quot; is subjective in design (client sign-off? implemented &amp; accepted designs?)</li>
</ul>

<!-- - A fixation on following an old plan in a new situation.

### Define Acceptance Criteria -->
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>What compounds the estimation problem? The fact that we do</p>

<h2>Fixed-bid <em>vs.</em> <br /> Time-and-Materials billing</h2>

<p>(more about that later)</p>

<h2>WHAT IS THE BIG DESIGN REFACTOR?</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Design starts with <br /> <em>systematic thinking</em></h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>and then shifts to <br /> <em>incremental changes</em>.</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>No matter where a project starts,</p>

<h2>at some point the design systems’ integrity will degrade</h2>

<p>to the point that you need to look at the whole thing fresh.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step'  id=bigdesignrefactor>
    
<h1>Welcome to the Big Design Refactor.</h1>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>In the beginning, you had a</p>

<h2>Beautiful, well-considered visual design system</h2>

<p>Type, whitespace, etc.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Then</p>

<h2>the project got Agile</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>And then you had to watch, helplessly, as your design system</p>

<h2>degraded under the weight of a thousand tiny changes.</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>nobody&#39;s being an asshole; it&#39;s just that</p>

<h2>Domain discovery =&gt; changes in semantics =&gt; changes in design</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>It’s maddening, and a big reason</p>

<h2>many designers are allergic to Agile methodologies.</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>What can you do?</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Understand and accept that</p>

<h2>this design-system degradation is an affordance of differently-sized design and development cycles</h2>

<p>is the first step towards making peace.</p>

<p><img src="cycles.png" alt="cycles"></p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Once you realize and</p>

<h2>accept this change,</h2>

<p>it’s much easier to deal with.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Agile Designers Prayer</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Grant me the serenity</p>

<p>To accept the things I cannot change;</p>

<p>The courage to change the things I can;</p>

<p>And the wisdom to know the difference.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Communicate</p>

<h2>Plan on it.</h2>

<p>Talk about it with your team.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Designers need not work at developers tempo.</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Rather, they should strive to</p>

<h2>stay in-rhythm with development,</h2>

<p>working at their own pace, and making sure their beats and decision-points intersect with development at regular intervals.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>As the designer, it’s your job to</p>

<h2>keep an eye on the health of the graphic system.</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Just as the developers incur and pay down their technical debt, you’ll</p>

<h2>manage your design debt.</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>How?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Mention that the graphic system is starting to break down.</li>
<li>All the while, you’re still doing your work.</li>
<li>Keep solving the tactical problems, keep delivering value.</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step'  id=prayer>
    
<p>At some point,</p>

<h2>the balance shifts</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>you’re no longer</p>

<h2>plugging little leaks or engaging in preventative maintenance.</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>The system is undermined;</h2>

<p>the cracks are starting to show.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Now’s the time to</p>

<h2>have a talk with your team.</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>You’re going to need a few weeks to work on this.</h2>

<p>You’re going to need the development team to find something design-light and backend-heavy to focus on for a week or two.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Hold a design retro.</p>

<h2>Get their feedback,</h2>

<p>and their buy-in, and their good ideas.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>And now you’ll have a break from the tactical work of patching up design as features iterate.</p>

<h2>You’re a Pure Designer again,</h2>

<p>working in your idiom, experimenting and sketching and building a new design system.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h1>BTW</h1>

<ul>
<li>&quot;I do&quot; language is better than &quot;you should&quot; language</li>
<li>I sound like a Hero Designer here. Where&#39;s the team? Where&#39;s the collaboration?</li>
<li>Can this be more less &quot;I&quot; language and more &quot;facilitator&quot; language?</li>

<h1>JPB: DO A TIME CHECK HERE. CAN I GET INTO OTHER STUFF? STRAIGHT INTO SUSTAINABLE PACE?</h1>

<p>come in, reitierate the other three items
bust into &quot;sus pace is the key&quot;</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>We don&#39;t have time for the other 3:
- √ Right level of resolution via BDR
- Getting out of the deliverable bness
- Shared ownership
- Acceptance criteria</p>

<h2>Fixed-bid <em>vs.</em> <br /> Time-and-Materials billing</h2>

<p>(JPB: this is a shitty transition)</p>

      <div class='step' >
    
<h1>Why Sustainable Pace First?</h1>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h1>Area of greatest risk</h1>

<ul>
<li>It requires a shift in the traditional design fixed-bid billing model</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Why Sustainable Pace First?</h2>

<ul>
<li>It&#39;s the most in our control,</li>
<li>It&#39;s the foundation upon which we can build these other things,</li>
<li>Designers deserve to be happy!</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h1>Sustainable pace</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>What does it mean to maintain a constant pace indefinitely in design?</h2>

<ul>
<li>A healthy, human practice (TimeOut, ping pong, 40-hour weeks)</li>
<li><s>rock stars</s> collaborative practices</li>
<li>Build and share a better toolkit (a lot of this work is already being done by the Lean UX movement)</li>
</ul>

<h1>It&#39;ll be an uphill battle</h1>

<ul>
<li>But it&#39;s only a messaging problem (not a product problem).</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>What next?</h2>

<ul>
<li>We have to spread the word,</li>
