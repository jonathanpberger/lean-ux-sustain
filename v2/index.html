<h1>What problems does the Agile Manifesto solve?</h1>

<ul>
<li>The first problem is killing developer productivity by constantly shifting priorities and directions.</li>
<li>The second problem is an inability for product owners to make well-informed tradeoffs around priorities.</li>
<li>The third problem is having too many unnecessary meetings and status checks.</li>
<li>The fourth problem is an inability to accurately predict when a project will be done, primarily with the aim of either cutting scope or moving the deadline (or adding developers, which is always dicey), and knowing that one of those will need to be done as much ahead of time as possible.</li>
<li>The fifth problem is frustrated developers due to poorly-defined features.</li>
<li>The sixth problem is the temptation to adjust the quality knob in order to meet a date target.</li>
<li>Lastly, this isn’t so much a problem per se, but agile builds in time for reflection on the product and the process.</li>
</ul>

<h2>(Let&#39;s see that again)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sclerosis around processes and tools,</li>

<p>What exactly are these problems? And how can Agilists and designers address them?</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<!-- 96-100 -->

<p>I first realized something was amiss when I started going to meetups</p>

<li>devs talk, client say &quot;ok&quot;.</li>

      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>How to reconcile</h2>

<li>&quot;devs are golden&quot; and &quot;design is a high-leverage activity&quot; reconcile?</li>
<li><strong>CURIOUS!</strong></li>

<p>There is a</p>

<h1>Symptoms of this sickness</h1>

<ul>
<li>Designers aren&#39;t listened to.</li>
<li>Designers work crazy hours.</li>
<li>Designers spend time designing things that are never built</li>
<li>We don&#39;t get in front of users early enough</li>
<li>imbalance between Design&#39;s effect and it&#39;s voice on the team</li>

<h1>The Oppressed Designer</h1>

<ul>
<li>Long nights</li>
<li>&quot;I got tired of nothing I designed ever being built&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Where are you hiding the people who yell at you&quot; --&gt; Insecure Design</li>

</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h1>Why is Agile so tough for designers?</h1>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Because we don&#39;t know <br /> when we&#39;re done</h2>

<ul>
<li>&quot;done&quot; is objective in TDD development (a passing build)</li>
<li>&quot;done&quot; is subjective in design (client sign-off? implemented &amp; accepted designs?)</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Because we&#39;re in <br /> the deliverables business</h2>

<ul>
<li>the deliverable for development is working, user-facing code</li>
<li>the deliverable for design ought to be Design Solutions</li>
<li>we&#39;re set up as a business to bill for mockups instead</li>
</ul>

<li>Dev: INVEST, small pieces</li>

<p>The</p>

<h1>Big Design Refactor</h1>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>WHAT IS THE BIG DESIGN REFACTOR?</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Design starts with <br /> <em>systematic thinking</em></h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>and then shifts to <br /> <em>incremental changes</em>.</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>No matter where a project starts,</p>

<h2>at some point the design systems’ integrity will degrade</h2>

<p>to the point that you need to look at the whole thing fresh.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h1>Welcome to the Big Design Refactor.</h1>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>In the beginning, you had a</p>

<h2>Beautiful, well-considered visual design system</h2>

<p>Type, whitespace, etc.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Then</p>

<h2>the project got Agile</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>And then you had to watch, helplessly, as your design system</p>

<h2>degraded under the weight of a thousand tiny changes.</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Domain discovery =&gt; changes in semantic</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>It’s maddening, and a big reason</p>

<h2>many designers are allergic to Agile methodologies.</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>What can you do?</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Understanding and accepting that</p>

<h2>this design-system degradation is an affordance of differently-sized design and development cycles</h2>

<p>is the first step towards making peace.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Once you realize and</p>

<h2>accept this change,</h2>

<p>it’s much easier to deal with.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Agile Designers Prayer</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>grant me the serenity</p>

<p>to accept the things I cannot change;</p>

<p>courage to change the things I can;</p>

<p>and wisdom to know the difference.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Communicate</h2>

<p>Plan on it.
Talk about it with your team.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Designers need not work at developers tempo.</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Rather, they should strive to</p>

<h2>stay in-rhythm with development,</h2>

<p>working at their own pace, and making sure their beats and decision-points intersect with development at regular intervals.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>As the designer, it’s your job to</p>

<h2>keep an eye on the health of the graphic system.</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Just as the developers incur and pay down their technical debt, you’ll</p>

<h2>manage your design debt.</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>How?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Mention that the graphic system is starting to break down.</li>
<li>All the while, you’re still doing your work.</li>
<li>Keep solving the tactical problems, keep delivering value.</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>At some point,</p>

<h2>the balance shifts</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>you’re no longer</p>

<h2>plugging little leaks or engaging in preventative maintenance.</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>The system is undermined;</h2>

<p>the cracks are starting to show.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Now’s the time to</p>

<h2>have a talk with your team.</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>You’re going to need a few weeks to work on this.</h2>

<p>You’re going to need the development team to find something design-light and backend-heavy to focus on for a week or two.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Hold a design retro.</p>

<h2>Get their feedback,</h2>

<p>and their buy-in, and their good ideas.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>And now you’ll have a break from the tactical work of patching up design as features iterate.</p>

<h2>You’re a Pure Designer again,</h2>

<p>working in your idiom, experimenting and sketching and building a new design system.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h1>BTW</h1>

<ul>
<li>&quot;I do&quot; language is better than &quot;you should&quot; language</li>
<li>I sound like a Hero Designer here. Where&#39;s the team? Where&#39;s the collaboration?</li>
<li>Can this be more less &quot;I&quot; language and more &quot;facilitator&quot; language?</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Top 3 areas for improvement:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Acceptance Criteria-delimited design stories

<ul>
<li><em>(What counts as &#39;done&#39;?)</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Meaningful estimation of work for design

<ul>
<li><em>(When will it be done?)</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>A culture that values Sustainable Pace

<ul>
<li><em>(How can we keep doing it?)</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h1>Sustainable pace</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>What does it mean to maintain a constant pace indefinitely in design?</h2>

<ul>
<li>A healthy, human practice (TimeOut, ping pong, 40-hour weeks)</li>
<li><s>rock stars</s> collaborative practices</li>
<li>Build and share a better toolkit (a lot of this work is already being done by the Lean UX movement)</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h1>Why Sustainable Pace First?</h1>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h1>Area of greatest risk</h1>

<ul>
<li>It requires a shift in the traditional design fixed-bid billing model</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Why Sustainable Pace First?</h2>

<ul>
<li>It&#39;s the most in our control,</li>
<li>It&#39;s the foundation upon which we can build these other things,</li>
<li>Designers deserve to be happy!</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h1>It&#39;ll be an uphill battle</h1>

<ul>
<li>But it&#39;s only a messaging problem (not a product problem).</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>What next?</h2>

<ul>
<li>We have to spread the word,</li>
<li>argue about it,</li>
<li>argue for it.</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
