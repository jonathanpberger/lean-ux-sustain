# Sustainable Pace, Agile, and The Big Design Refactor
Lean UX NYC, 2013

Jonathan Berger, Pivotal Labs

# Hi!

---

## I'm @jonathanpberger

---

I read and write code every day to build **products** and **practice** at
## @pivotallabs

---

## WARNINGS:
- we're mostly talking about Apps, (*not* content sites.)
- we're mostly talking about Consultancies, (*not* Product companies.)

---

# Once upon a time...

---

## Developers had problems

- Sclerosis around processes and tools,
- Compulsive (CYA) documentation,
- Endless negotiation about targets and deliverables,
- A fixation on following an old plan in a new situation.

---

### What happened?

---

## *Individuals & interactions* over processes & tools

## *Working software* over comprehensive documentation

## *Customer collaboration* over contract negotiation

## *Responding to change* over following a plan

---

### (Let's see that again)
- Sclerosis around processes and tools,
- Compulsive (CYA) documentation,
- Endless negotiation about targets and deliverables,
- A fixation on following an old plan in a new situation.

---

## Designers have analogous problems

---

### 1. Sclerosis around processes and tools,
## Designers use PSDs to represent interaction!

---

### 2. Compulsive (CYA) documentation,
## Designers are paid by the deliverable!

---

### 3. Endless negotiation about targets and deliverables,
## Designers are terrible at estimating when we're done

---

### 4. A fixation on following an old plan in a new situation.
## Designers are terrible at defining what 'done' means

---

# How can Design benefit from Agile?

---

# 1. Individuals & Interactions over processes & tools.

---

The
## Big Design Refactor

---

## In the beginning...

---

Then
## the project got Agile

---

## Development solutions: I.N.V.E.S.T., small pieces
## Design solutions: Malleable, never done, holistic

---

## degraded under the weight of a thousand tiny changes.

---

## designers have to play catch-up in a race they can't win

---

this is
## infuriating

---

## Understand and accept

---

## this design-system degradation is an affordance of differently-sized design and development cycles

---
= id=prayer

## Agile Designers Prayer

> Grant me the serenity

> To accept the things I cannot change;

> The courage to change the things I can;

> And the wisdom to know the difference.

---

## Designers need not work at developers tempo.

---

## stay in-rhythm with development, not on-pace

---

## Communicate

---

## keep an eye on the health of the graphic system.

---

## manage your design debt.

---

## How?
- Mention that the graphic system is starting to break down.
- All the while, you’re still doing your work.
- Keep solving the tactical problems, keep delivering value.

---

## the balance shifts

---

Now’s the time to
## talk with your team.

---

## You need time

---

## Get their feedback,

---

## You’re a Pure Designer again

---

## SOLUTION: account for the Big Design Refactor
1. accept
2. plan
3. communicate
4. refactor

---
Working software over
# 2. Comprehensive documentation

---

or
## Getting out of the deliverables business

---

## Jeff covers this well

---

## Agile Developers ultimately deliver user-facing code

---

## designers output design thinking

---

<!-- ## How should the two interact?
- Should design stay an iteration ahead of development?
- What happens when developers discover interaction problems during implementation?
- Should they stop work?

--- -->

<!-- It can be **difficult to determine** -->
## How much documentation is required?
<!-- for developers to complete their work -->

---

<!-- The best design deliverable is -->
## SOLUTION: the Simplest Thing That Can Possibly Communicate the Design Solution
<!-- This can vary from team to team and design problem to design problem. -->

---

# 3. Collaboration over Negotiation

---
## designers hating agile

- feeling rushed,
- feeling like they don’t get the benefit of iterative design;
- feeling that once they touch something, they don’t get to go back and refactor it.

---

Developers have
## Collective ownership of code

---

## Design culture

- prizes individuality,
- venerates Rock Star Designers
- that applauds Working On It Til Its Done,
- publicly shreds less-than-perfect work in Crit as a rite of passage,

---

## Empathy

---

## Let’s throw in a bit of
- rah-rah agile ideology,
- a few jargon-y IPMs and retros,
- promises that “we’ll come back and refactor that later”, and
- the creeping suspicion that this whole Agile thing is nothing but smoke, mirrors, and Kool-Ade.

---

## Is it any wonder that designers can be hostile to agile?

---

## SOLUTION: Adopt Sustainable pace

---

# 4. WHEN IS DESIGN DONE?

---

<!-- Agile development preaches -->

## “Done means Done”.

<!-- - When a story is accepted by the Product Owner, it’s ready to be deployed out into the world.  -->

---

## What does “done” mean for design?

---

<!-- ## Automated testing -->

<!-- guarantees that on every story, developers will enjoy ** -->
## Acceptance Criteria

<!-- ### a concrete measure of what counts as “done”. -->

---

<!-- Designers, on the other hand, rely on -->
## subjective criteria
<!-- to determine when they’re done. -->

---

<!-- ### In the best case,
this means the product team—or often, the designer working alone—if only they had a partner to pair with!

### In the worst case
this is purely subjective sign-off from the client.
 -->
---

<!-- Agile developers have access to tools like -->
## velocity
 <!-- to plan their work, -->

---

<!-- designers have structural difficulties in -->
## estimation,
<!-- and are consequently less able to plan. -->

---

<!-- questions like -->
## “when will that feature be done?”
<!-- are more easily answered by a developer than a designer. -->

---

<!-- That’s not because designers are less responsible than developers.
It’s because -->
## it’s harder to know when you’re done
<!-- with design -->

---

<!-- ## that’s of little comfort
to anyone who needs to budget time and resources to manage the project.

---

an answer to the question “what does ‘done’ mean?”, aka
## Acceptance Criteria for design
is in different units of work than “done” for development

---

Consequently, there’s
## an impedance mismatch
in coordinating between the two. -->

<!-- --- -->

## SOLUTION: Break design into units of work with <br />**more discrete Acceptance Criteria**<br />helps coordinate design and development work.

---

# Conclusion: Sustainable pace first

---

## TL;DR
- Designers will benefit from adopting Agile techniques,
- We should start with Sustainable Pace,
- This is a cultural shift we'll need to advocate for.

---

## Nothing budges til we fix the billing problem

---

## Sustainable pace

> Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

---

## What does it mean to maintain a constant pace indefinitely in design?

- A healthy, human practice (TimeOut, ping pong, 40-hour weeks)
- <s>rock stars</s> collaborative practices
- Build and share a better toolkit (a lot of this work is already being done by the Lean UX movement)
- Treating ourselves better

---


## Why? Area of greatest risk

- It requires a shift in the traditional design fixed-bid billing model

---

## Why Sustainable Pace First?

- It's the most in our control,
- It's the foundation upon which we can build these other things,
- Designers deserve to be happy!

---

## It'll be an uphill battle
- But it's only a messaging problem (not a product problem).

---

## What next?

- We have to spread the word,
- argue about it,
- argue for it.
