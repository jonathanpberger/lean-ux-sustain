# Sustainable Pace, Agile, and The Big Design Refactor
Lean UX NYC, 2013

# 1. Sustainable Pace

---

# Call to arms

---

I see many
## unhappy designers

---

## overwhelmed

---

asked to work at someone else's
## tempo

---

wasn't agile supposed to be a
## solution

---

## rushed

---

## disempowered

---

## promises are made

---

## work harder

---

## longer

---

## race they can't win

---

## design culture

---

## rock star

---

## all nighters

---

## design-school crit

---

## expected to be right

---

## expected to be perfect

---

## empathy

---

## sustainable pace

---

## constant speed

---

## call to arms

---

# designers should adopt sustainable pace as a value

---

---

# 2. Agile

---

## solution

---

## problem

---

## Why?

---

## similar problems

---

- Sclerosis around processes and tools,
- Compulsive (CYA) documentation,
- Endless negotiation about targets and deliverables,
- A fixation on following old plans in a new situations.

---

## designers coping with Agile

---

# We should be asking "How can Agile serve designers?"

---

---

# 3. Big Design Refactor

---

## In the beginning...

---

Then
## the project got Agile

---

## Development solutions: I.N.V.E.S.T., small pieces
## Design solutions: Malleable, never done, holistic

---

## product iterates

---

## degrades under the weight of a thousand tiny changes.

---

## designers have to play catch-up in a race they can't win

---

this is
## infuriating

---

## Understand and accept

---

## this design-system degradation is an affordance of differently-sized design and development cycles

---
= id=prayer

## Agile Designers Prayer

> Grant me the serenity

> To accept the things I cannot change;

> The courage to change the things I can;

> And the wisdom to know the difference.

---

## Designers need not work at developers tempo.

---

## stay in-rhythm with development, not on-pace

---

## Communicate

---

## keep an eye on the health of the graphic system.

---

## manage your design debt.

---

## How?
- Mention that the graphic system is starting to break down.
- All the while, you’re still doing your work.
- Keep solving the tactical problems, keep delivering value.

---

## the balance shifts

---

## talk with your team.

---

## Design retro

---

## Do systematic visual Design

---

# work with Big Design Refactor, not against it.

<!-- ## HOW DOES THE BIG DESIGN REFACTOR WORK?
When I’m in the midst of a Big Design Refactor, I’m spending most of my day in Adobe Creative Suite. I’m pulling the product team over ~4-7 times a week to bounce ideas off of them. I’m pinging the development team ~1-2 times a week to consult on the technical implications of where I’m going. By the end of the week or two, I’m usually delivering a set of user stories accompanied by mockups. It’ll often take an IPM or two to get through all of them, and it’s important that they get implemented soon. Nothing feels more like waste than a heavy investment in design, followed by unacted-upon stories that go stale. This will kill trust between the design and product teams (in both directions); it’s downright poisonous.

---

Now, while the new design is being built by developers, I’ll occasionally hop back into Adobe Creative Suite for assets or newly-discovered UX tweaks, but most of my time is spent pairing with developers. I’ll also keep a close eye on acceptance. Pixel-perfection is rarely necessary, but miss an important UX point now and the error will become enshrined as part of the system.

---

Once the Design Refactor has been assimilated into the app—and it’s rare that 100% goes in, but 80-90% is the norm—it’s Tactical Incremental Fun Time! I’ll spend most of this time pairing on stories, picking of styling stories to solo on, and working on design problems revealed by user testing. At this point it’s probably 66% development and 33% Adobe apps. The debt clock is starting to tick again, and once the pain is noticeable, I’ll start making noises: “we’re ok for right this second, but we’re going to need a design refactor in the next 3-5 weeks”.

# Call to Action

---

# Call to Arms

---

# Designers should recognize the rhythms and tempos of design and development

---

# Designers should look to agile as a solution, not just a problem

---

# Designers should adopt sustainable pace as a value.
